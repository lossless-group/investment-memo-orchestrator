# Changelog - 2025-11-27 (#1)

## Emerging Manager Outline with Proprietary Scorecard Vocabulary

### Overview
Created a comprehensive outline for evaluating LP commitments to emerging manager VC funds, integrating Hypernova Capital's proprietary 12-dimension GP evaluation framework directly into the memo generation system.

---

## New File: `templates/outlines/lpcommit-emerging-manager.yaml`

**Size:** 1,806 lines

### Purpose
Streamlined structure for evaluating LP commitments to first-time fund managers, solo GPs, and funds under $50M where institutional track record data may be limited.

### Key Innovation
Unlike generic templates, this outline embeds **proprietary vocabulary and evaluation frameworks** directly into the guiding questions, preferred sources, and section requirements—ensuring AI-generated memos reflect the firm's actual thinking, not generic analysis.

## The 12-Dimension Scorecard Framework

### Three Dimension Groups (Strategically Placed)

| Group | Section Placement | Dimensions |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| **1. Founder & Deal Dynamics** | GP Background (§2) | Empathy, Theory of Market, Ecosystem Imprint, Hustle |
| **2. Execution & Investment Style** | Fund Strategy (§3) | Pull Force, Pounce, Integrity, Grip |
| **3. Portfolio Management & Discipline** | Early Signals (§6) | Judgement, Discipline, Positioning, Prudence |

### Each Dimension Includes

For each of the 12 dimensions, the outline provides:

1. **Definition** - Full description from the Hypernova scorecard
2. **Evaluation Questions** - 4 specific questions to research
3. **Evidence Sources** - Where to find supporting data
4. **Red Flags** - Warning signs to watch for
5. **Scoring Rubric** - 1-5 scale with detailed criteria

### Example: "Hustle" Dimension

```yaml
- term: "hustle"
  usage: "Super-human level of omnipresence and energy"
  definition: |
    Rising above the world of existing early-stage venture firms requires
    sweat-inducing levels of energy. The methods are myriad, but the result
    is a super-human level of omnipresence.
  evaluation_questions:
    - "What is the GP's meeting cadence and founder outreach volume?"
    - "How quickly do they respond to opportunities?"
    - "Are they consistently present at key ecosystem events?"
    - "Do they create their own deal flow through proactive outreach?"
  evidence_sources:
    - "Meeting and outreach metrics"
    - "Event attendance and hosting"
    - "Response time to opportunities"
  red_flags:
    - "Passive investment approach"
    - "Slow response to opportunities"
    - "Limited proactive founder engagement"
  scoring:
    5: "Exceptional energy; omnipresent in ecosystem; creates own luck"
    4: "High energy; proactive approach; consistently present"
    3: "Adequate activity level; standard VC engagement"
    2: "Below average activity; reactive approach"
    1: "Passive; minimal proactive engagement"
```

## Proprietary Vocabulary Terms

Beyond the 12 scorecard dimensions, the outline includes proprietary terminology:

| Term | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **jagged resume** | Non-linear career path with varied experiences |
| **transferable credibility** | Skills from adjacent domains that translate to fund management |
| **bold bets** | Contrarian investments in overlooked founders or dismissed segments |
| **slugging percentage** | % of early portfolio showing breakout potential |
| **wow percentage** | % of portfolio that looks mindblowing |
| **codifying art into science** | Systematizing intuition into frameworks |
| **maven** | Deep domain expert founders seek out |
| **pull force** | Founders actively seeking the GP |
| **dealflow engine** | Systems for repeatable deal sourcing |
| **ecosystem imprint** | Memorable presence among founders and brokers |

---

## Section Structure (10 Sections)

1. **Executive Summary** - Investment thesis, recommendation, key risks
2. **GP Background & Credibility** - Character, jagged resume, theory of market (Group 1 dimensions)
3. **Fund Strategy & Thesis** - Investment focus, right to win, dealflow (Group 2 dimensions)
4. **Portfolio Construction** - Check sizes, reserves, concentration
5. **Value-Add & Differentiation** - Support model, signal power
6. **Early Signals & Leading Indicators** - Bold bets, early breakouts (Group 3 dimensions)
7. **Fee Structure & Economics** - Management fees, carry, alignment
8. **LP Base & References** - Co-investors, founder references
9. **Risks & Mitigations** - Key person risk, market risk
10. **Recommendation** - Final assessment with conviction level

---

## Additional Features

### Custom Memo Date Support

Added `memo_date` field to company data JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "Don't Quit Ventures",
  "type": "fund",
  "mode": "justify",
  "outline": "lpcommit-emerging-manager",
  "memo_date": "January 10, 2025",
  ...
}
```

- Export now uses custom date instead of today's date
- Supports multiple formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `Month DD, YYYY`, etc.
- Falls back to today's date if not specified

### Citation Consolidation Utility

New `cli/utils/consolidate_citations.py`:

- Consolidates scattered per-section citation blocks into ONE block at document end
- Globally renumbers footnotes sequentially
- Fixes malformed markdown concatenation issues

## Why This Matters

### Problem Solved
AI-generated memos risk being too generic. Without firm-specific frameworks, analysis lacks differentiation and doesn't reflect the firm's actual investment thesis.

### Solution
By embedding proprietary vocabulary, evaluation questions, and scoring rubrics directly into the outline:

1. **Research agents** know what evidence to prioritize
2. **Writer agents** use firm-specific terminology
3. **Output reflects** the firm's actual thinking, not generic AI content
4. **Scorecards** can eventually be auto-generated from memo content

---

## Usage

```bash
# Create company data file with outline reference
cat > data/MyFund.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "My Fund",
  "type": "fund",
  "mode": "consider",
  "outline": "lpcommit-emerging-manager",
  "memo_date": "January 15, 2025"
}
EOF

# Generate memo
python -m src.main "MyFund"

# Export with custom date
python cli/export_branded.py output/MyFund-v0.0.1/4-final-draft.md --brand hypernova --mode dark
# Output: "Using custom memo date: January 15, 2025"
```
