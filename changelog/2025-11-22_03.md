# Changelog - 2025-11-22 (Part 3)

## Tier 2 Anti-Hallucination: Fact-Checker Agent Implementation

### Overview
Implemented the fact-checker agent to prevent hallucinated metrics and claims in investment memos. This agent verifies all factual claims against research sources, catching fabricated revenue figures, pricing data, customer counts, and other metrics before final memo assembly.

**Impact**: Complete Tier 2 of the three-tier anti-hallucination defense system, adding automated verification layer that catches unsourced claims missed by prompt engineering.

---

## Problem Statement

### Critical Issue: LLM Hallucination of Metrics

**Examples of Fabricated Data:**
- Inventing revenue figures ($2.5M ARR with no source)
- Making up pricing tiers ($99/month Basic, $299/month Pro)
- Fabricating customer counts (150 paying customers)
- Creating growth rates (35% MoM)
- Inventing unit economics (LTV:CAC ratios)

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Trust Destruction**: One fabricated number destroys credibility of entire memo
2. **Investment Risk**: Partners making decisions on false data
3. **Legal Liability**: Misrepresenting company metrics in investment documents
4. **Reputation Damage**: Founders recognizing invented facts about their own company

**Root Cause**: Even with Tier 1 prompt engineering fixes, LLMs still fabricate when:
- Data gaps exist (pre-revenue startups)
- Guiding questions create demand pressure
- Word count requirements need filling
- Inference blurs into assertion

**Solution**: Automated fact-checking that verifies every claim against source data.

---

## New Features

### 1. Fact-Checker Agent (`src/agents/fact_checker.py`)

#### Agent Architecture

**Purpose**: Verify all factual claims against research sources before final validation

**Workflow**:
```
1. Load each section file from 2-sections/
2. Extract factual claims (metrics, financials, dates, names)
3. Verify each claim against research data
4. Check for inline citations [^N]
5. Flag unsourced or suspicious claims by severity
6. Mark sections requiring rewrite if critical issues found
7. Save detailed fact-check report (5-fact-check.json + .md)
```

**Position in Pipeline**:
```
... → Citations → Citation Validator → FACT CHECK → Validate → ...
```

---

#### Claim Extraction Engine

**Function**: `extract_factual_claims(section_content: str)`

**12 Claim Types Detected**:

```python
patterns = {
    "metric": r'\b(\d+[KMB]?|[\d,]+)\s+(ARR|MRR|customers?|users?|revenue|MAU|DAU|employees?)',
    "financial": r'\$[\d,]+[KMB]?',
    "percentage": r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?%\b',
    "growth": r'\b\d+%\s+(MoM|YoY|month[- ]over[- ]month|year[- ]over[- ]year|CAGR|growth)',
    "date": r'\b(20\d{2}|Q[1-4]\s+20\d{2}|Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)\s+20\d{2}\b',
    "customer_name": r'\b(customers? include|clients? include|partnerships? with|backed by|investors? include)\s+[A-Z][a-z]+',
    "pricing": r'\$[\d,]+\s*(per|/)\s*(month|user|seat|year|license|annually)',
    "valuation": r'\$([\d.]+[KMB])\s+(valuation|pre-money|post-money)',
    "runway": r'\b\d+\s+months?\s+(runway|of runway|burn)',
    "team_size": r'\b\d+\s+(person|people|employees?|team members?)',
    "funding_round": r'\$([\d.]+[KMB])\s+(seed|Series [A-Z]|round)',
}
```

**Extraction Logic**:
- Split section into sentences
- Pattern match each sentence
- Skip explicit "data not available" statements
- Classify by claim type and specificity (high/medium/low)

**Example Output**:
```python
{
    "claim_text": "The company has generated $2.5M in ARR with 150 paying customers.",
    "claim_type": "metric",
    "specificity": "high"
}
```

---

#### Claim Verification Engine

**Function**: `verify_claim_against_research(claim, research_data, section_content)`

**Verification Strategy**:

1. **Check for Inline Citation**: Does claim have `[^N]` marker?
   - YES → Mark as **verified** (severity: low)
   - NO → Continue to step 2

2. **Search Research Data**: Do claim numbers appear in research?
   - Extract numbers from claim
   - Search research JSON for matching numbers
   - Calculate evidence ratio (key terms found / total terms)

3. **Apply Severity Rules**:

**High-Risk Claims** (metric, financial, pricing, valuation, growth, funding_round):
- Evidence ratio > 50% → **unsourced** (severity: high, action: request_source)
- Evidence ratio ≤ 50% → **suspicious** (severity: critical, action: remove)

**Medium-Risk Claims** (date, team_size, runway):
- Evidence ratio > 40% → **unsourced** (severity: medium, action: request_source)
- Evidence ratio ≤ 40% → **suspicious** (severity: high, action: flag_for_review)

**Low-Risk Claims** (customer names, partnerships):
- Evidence ratio > 60% → **unsourced** (severity: medium, action: request_source)
- Evidence ratio ≤ 60% → **suspicious** (severity: high, action: flag_for_review)

---

#### Section Fact-Checking

**Function**: `fact_check_section(section_name, section_content, research_data, strictness)`

**Parameters**:
- `section_name`: Section being checked (e.g., "Traction & Milestones")
- `section_content`: Full section markdown
- `research_data`: Research dict with sources
- `strictness`: "low" (40%), "medium" (60%), "high" (80%)

**Process**:
1. Extract all claims from section
2. Verify each claim against research
3. Calculate section score (verified / total)
4. Determine if rewrite required:
   - ANY critical severity claims → requires_rewrite = True
   - Score < strictness threshold → requires_rewrite = True

**Output**: `SectionFactCheck` dataclass
```python
@dataclass
class SectionFactCheck:
    section_name: str
    total_claims: int
    verified_claims: int
    unsourced_claims: int
    suspicious_claims: int
    fact_check_results: List[FactCheckResult]
    overall_score: float  # 0-1 where 1 = all claims sourced
    requires_rewrite: bool
    flagged_for_review: List[str]  # Critical claims
```

---

#### Main Agent Function

**Function**: `fact_checker_agent(state: MemoState)`

**Workflow**:
```python
1. Load company_name and research_data from state
2. Find latest output directory
3. Get sections from 2-sections/ directory
4. For each section:
   - Read section content
   - Extract claims
   - Verify against research
   - Flag critical issues
5. Calculate overall statistics
6. Save fact-check report (5-fact-check.json + .md)
7. Return state updates with fact_check_results
```

**Terminal Output**:
```

## Technical Details

### Strictness Levels

| Level | Threshold | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **low** | 40% sourced | Exploratory memos, internal only |
| **medium** | 60% sourced | Partner review memos |
| **high** | 80% sourced | External-facing, final memos (default) |

**Configuration**:
```bash
# In .env file
FACT_CHECK_STRICTNESS=high  # default
```

---

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (Automatic Removal Recommended)
- Specific metric with no citation AND no evidence in research
- **Example**: "$2.5M ARR" with no source and not mentioned in research
- **Action**: Remove claim or add "Data not available" statement

#### High (Flag for Review)
- Claim not found in research data
- **Example**: "35% MoM growth" with no supporting evidence
- **Action**: Add citation or remove

#### Medium (Request Source)
- Claim appears in research but lacks citation
- **Example**: Revenue mentioned in research but section doesn't cite it
- **Action**: Add inline citation [^N]

#### Low (Verified)
- Claim has inline citation
- **Example**: "According to TechCrunch [^5], revenue is $5M"
- **Action**: Accept

---

### Data Structures

#### FactCheckResult
```python
@dataclass
class FactCheckResult:
    claim: str                  # The sentence making the claim
    claim_type: str             # "metric", "financial", "pricing", etc.
    is_sourced: bool            # Has citation?
    source_citation: Optional[str]  # e.g., "[^5]"

```

---

## Performance & Impact

### Expected Metrics

**Before Tier 2 (Prompt Engineering Only - Tier 1)**:
- Unsourced metrics: ~15% (reduced from ~40% by Tier 1)
- Hallucination detection: Manual review only
- False positives: Not measured

**After Tier 2 (With Fact-Checker)**:
- Unsourced metrics: ~5% (automated detection)
- Hallucination detection: Automated with severity classification
- False positives: <10% (claim extraction is conservative)

### Cost Impact
- **Additional API calls**: Zero (uses existing research data)
- **Processing time**: +10-15 seconds per memo (claim extraction + verification)
- **Storage**: +2 files per memo (5-fact-check.json + .md)

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Pre-Revenue Startup (Seed Stage)

**Input Section** (Traction & Milestones):
```markdown
The company has generated $500K in ARR with 25 paying customers
across enterprise and SMB segments. Growth has been strong at 40%
MoM, driven by product-led acquisition.
```

**Fact-Check Results**:
```
Claims found: 3
- "$500K in ARR" → CRITICAL: No citation, not in research → REMOVE
- "25 paying customers" → CRITICAL: No citation, not in research → REMOVE
- "40% MoM" → CRITICAL: No citation, not in research → REMOVE

Score: 0%
Status: REQUIRES REWRITE
```

**Expected Action**: Section rewritten to state "Revenue data not available" or removed entirely.

---

### Use Case 2: Public Startup (Series B)

**Input Section** (Traction & Milestones):
```markdown
According to TechCrunch [^5], the company reached $10M ARR in Q4 2024.
The customer count is approximately 500 across 20 countries. Growth
rate is estimated at 25% YoY.
```

**Fact-Check Results**:
```
Claims found: 3
- "$10M ARR in Q4 2024" → VERIFIED: Has citation [^5] → ACCEPT
- "approximately 500" customers → HIGH: No citation, uses "approximately" (speculation) → FLAG
- "estimated at 25% YoY" → HIGH: No citation, uses "estimated" (speculation) → FLAG

Score: 33%
Status: REQUIRES REWRITE
```

**Expected Action**: Add citations for customer count and growth rate, or remove speculative claims.

---

### Use Case 3: Well-Documented Company

**Input Section** (Traction & Milestones):
```markdown
According to their Series B press release [^3], the company reached
$50M ARR with 200 enterprise customers in Q3 2024. TechCrunch reported [^4]
that growth was 100% YoY, driven by expansion in the healthcare vertical.
```

**Fact-Check Results**:
```
Claims found: 3
- "$50M ARR" → VERIFIED: Has citation [^3] → ACCEPT
- "200 enterprise customers" → VERIFIED: Has citation [^3] → ACCEPT
- "100% YoY" → VERIFIED: Has citation [^4] → ACCEPT

Score: 100%
Status: PASSED
```

**Expected Action**: No changes needed, all claims sourced.

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Goals

| Metric | Before Tier 2 | After Tier 2 | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Unsourced revenue claims | ~15% | <5% | ⏳ To be measured |
| Unsourced pricing claims | ~10% | <5% | ⏳ To be measured |
| "Data not available" usage | ~0% | 15-25% | ⏳ To be measured |
| Overall fact-check score | Unknown | >80% | ⏳ To be measured |
| Hallucination incidents | 1-2/memo | 0/memo | ⏳ To be measured |

### Qualitative Goals
1. **Founder Validation**: Founders recognize actual company status (no surprise metrics)
2. **Partner Trust**: Partners confident in memo accuracy
3. **Legal Safety**: No misrepresentation of material facts
4. **Reputation Protection**: Memos shareable externally without risk

---

## Migration Notes

### For End Users

#### Automatic Activation
- Fact-checker runs automatically in workflow
- No configuration needed (uses default HIGH strictness)
- Output saved to `5-fact-check.json` and `5-fact-check.md`

#### Expected Behavior Changes
- **More "Data not available" statements**: Honest gaps instead of fabrication
- **Longer generation time**: +10-15 seconds for fact-checking
- **Section revision flags**: Some sections may be flagged for review
- **Higher memo quality**: All metrics verified against sources

### For Developers

#### Adjusting Strictness
```bash
# In .env file
FACT_CHECK_STRICTNESS=medium  # Use medium for less strict checking
```

#### Customizing Claim Patterns
Edit `extract_factual_claims()` in `src/agents/fact_checker.py`:
```python
patterns = {
    "metric": r'...',  # Modify regex patterns
    # Add new claim types
}
```

#### Testing Fact-Checker
```python
from src.agents.fact_checker import extract_factual_claims, verify_claim_against_research

# Test claim extraction
claims = extract_factual_claims("The company has $5M ARR.")
print(claims)

# Test verification
result = verify_claim_against_research(claim, research_data, section_content)
print(result.severity, result.recommended_action)
```

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Recommended Monitoring

Track for every memo:
```python
{
  "company": "Startup X",
  "fact_check_score": 0.69,
  "unsourced_critical_claims": 3,
  "sections_flagged": 2,
  "strictness": "high",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-22T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### Alert Conditions
- Fact-check score < 70%
- Any critical unsourced claims detected
- More than 2 sections flagged
- Founder reports fabrication (post-release)

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Pattern-Based Detection Limitations
**Issue**: Regex patterns may miss creative phrasing
**Example**: "revenue in the neighborhood of $5M" might not be detected
**Mitigation**: Conservative patterns (lower false negatives, may increase false positives)

### 2. Context-Free Verification
**Issue**: Claim verification doesn't understand semantic meaning
**Example**: "$5M" in research for different metric might false-positive match
**Mitigation**: Evidence ratio threshold (requires multiple term matches)

### 3. Citation Format Dependency
**Issue**: Only recognizes Obsidian-style citations `[^N]`
**Example**: IEEE citations `[1]` would be marked as unsourced
**Status**: Acceptable (system uses Obsidian format consistently)
