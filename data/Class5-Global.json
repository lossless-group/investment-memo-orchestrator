  "notes": "At the core of our thesis is one simple belief: emerging market founders have more to learn from each other than from Silicon Valley. We believe there is tragically little connective tissue bridging emerging markets together. Founders in Indonesia can learn more from Mexico (and vice versa) than they can from their peers in the United States. At Class 5, we aim to build this connective tissue. By investing in key themes such as financial infrastructure and cross border commerce across different emerging markets, we aim to further catalyze this emerging market technology renaissance. What works in one market (or doesnt) often works in other similar markets around the world. And, at Class 5 we aim to facilitate this flow of knowledge to help entrepreneurs build faster and more effectively.."
