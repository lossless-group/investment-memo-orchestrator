  # Correction 1: Add Business Model Pricing Details
  - type: "incomplete"
    incomplete_information: |
      The memo lacks specific pricing model details for Sava's trust administration services.
      Current sections discuss market opportunity and TAM calculations but don't specify
      the company's intended pricing structure.
    additional_information: |
      Sava's intended business model is a flat annual fee of $3,000-$5,000 per trust
      for administration services. The fee varies based on:
      - Jurisdiction (state trust law complexity)
      - Type of trust (directed vs. discretionary, revocable vs. irrevocable)

      This flat-fee model represents a significant departure from traditional trust company
      pricing, which typically charges:
      - 0.5%-1.0% of assets under management annually, PLUS
      - $3,000-$10,000 in administrative fees

      For a $1M trust, traditional pricing would be $8,000-$20,000/year vs. Sava's
      $3,000-$5,000 flat fee. This represents 50-75% cost savings for customers and
      positions Sava to expand the addressable market to smaller trusts that were
      previously uneconomical to administer professionally.

    narrative_shaping_comments:
      - "Frame the flat-fee model as a key competitive differentiator and market expansion enabler"
      - "Emphasize the unit economics advantage: predictable revenue per trust, not AUM-dependent"
      - "Connect to market expansion thesis: enables professional trust administration for $500K-$2M trusts that were previously uneconomical"
      - "Note that flat-fee model de-risks revenue from market volatility (AUM-based fees decline in down markets)"

  # Correction 2: Clarify Company Positioning
  - type: "inaccurate"
    inaccurate_information: |
      References to Sava as a "SaaS provider", "software company", "fintech platform", or
      "recurring software fees" without clarifying the core business model
    correct_information: |
      Sava is a scalable, AI-native trust administration company. It operates as a licensed
      trust company (pending charter approval) that uses AI to automate trust administration
      workflows. Sava is the fiduciary - it IS the trust company, not a software vendor
      selling to trust companies.

      The company charges a flat annual trust administration fee of $3,000-$5,000 per trust,
      not a software subscription fee. Revenue comes from being the trustee, not from
      licensing software.

    narrative_shaping_comments:
      - "Position as 'scalable, AI-native trust administration company' throughout"
      - "Clarify Sava is a trust company with AI, not an AI company selling to trust companies"
      - "The distinction matters for regulatory positioning and competitive moat"
      - "AI enables scalability - traditional trust companies need 1 trust officer per ~50-100 trusts"

  # Correction 3: Add Deal Terms
  - type: "incomplete"
    incomplete_information: |
      The Funding & Terms section lacks specific deal structure and valuation details.
    additional_information: |
      Sava is raising on a SAFE note with a $50M valuation cap.

      Deal structure:
      - Instrument: Post-money SAFE
      - Valuation cap: $50,000,000
