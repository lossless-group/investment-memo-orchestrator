<h2 id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>We committed capital to Class 5 Global’s debut fund in 2018, backing
a team focused on early-stage technology investments across emerging
markets with particular emphasis on the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region. The firm was founded by <strong>Joel Ayala</strong> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelayala/">LinkedIn</a>),
<strong>Zach Finkelstein</strong> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyfinkelstein/">LinkedIn</a>),
and Jonathan Krause, bringing complementary expertise and geographic
positioning with presence in both San Francisco and Abu Dhabi <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Our investment thesis centered on the GP’s strategic positioning in
underserved emerging markets, differentiated access through
Finkelstein’s UAE base, and the team’s early-stage investment
discipline. As of March 2025, the fund has deployed capital into 45
portfolio companies across automotive, financial software, and B2B
information services sectors, demonstrating active deployment and
portfolio construction discipline <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This memo serves as a retrospective justification of our investment
decision, documenting the strategic rationale, GP assessment, and risk
considerations that informed our commitment to this emerging manager in
the venture capital space.</p>

Record</h2>
<p><strong>General Partner(s)</strong>: - <strong>Joel Ayala</strong>
(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelayala/">LinkedIn</a>)
(Co-founder and Managing Partner): Based in San Francisco, brings U.S.
venture market experience and network. Specific prior investment
background not publicly disclosed <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. - <strong>Zach
Finkelstein</strong> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyfinkelstein/">LinkedIn</a>)
(Co-founder and Managing Partner): Based in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Early-stage
focused venture investor with emerging markets expertise. Grew up in the
U.S. before relocating to the Middle East, providing unique cultural
bridge. Currently serves as investor at RemyAI and Notable Labs in
addition to Class 5 role. - Jonathan Krause (Co-Founder &amp; COO):
Based in San Francisco. Educational background includes New York
University School of Law (2009-2010). Handles operational aspects of
fund management.</p>
<p><strong>Firm history</strong>: Class 5 Global (<a href="https://www.class5global.com">website</a>) was founded in 2018 as
a first-time fund focused on emerging market opportunities <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
The firm established dual geographic presence with offices in San
Francisco and Abu Dhabi, reflecting its strategy of bridging U.S.
venture capital expertise with emerging market deal flow. The founding
team structured the firm to leverage Finkelstein’s on-the-ground
presence in the UAE while maintaining connectivity to Silicon Valley
capital and ecosystem through Ayala and Krause <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investment team</strong>: The core team consists of three
founding partners with complementary functional expertise <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. The firm has developed a
fellowship/associate program, evidenced by Jamal Trotman’s participation
as a Summer Fellow/Associate, indicating investment in pipeline
development and talent cultivation. Total team size beyond the three
partners has not been publicly disclosed.</p>
<p><strong>Track record highlights</strong>: As a 2018 vintage fund,
Class 5 Global represents an emerging manager without prior fund
performance to benchmark. Our investment decision was based on founder
backgrounds, market positioning, and strategic thesis rather than
historical fund returns. The firm has demonstrated deployment discipline
with 45 investments completed as of March 2025, suggesting active
portfolio construction over the fund’s lifecycle <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fund-strategy-thesis">3. Fund Strategy &amp; Thesis</h2>
<p><strong>Investment focus</strong>: Early-stage venture capital
targeting technology companies in emerging markets, with particular
concentration in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
Portfolio construction shows sector diversification across automotive
technology (Invygo (<a href="https://www.invygo.com">website</a>)),
financial software (Ziina (<a href="https://www.ziina.com">website</a>),
Caliza), and B2B information services (BRKZ) <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.
The fund targets companies that can leverage emerging market growth
dynamics while building scalable technology platforms.</p>
<figure>
<img role="img" aria-label="Invygo App Interface" src="https://www.invygo.com/static/media/app-screens.a5cf61fd.png" alt="Invygo App Interface" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Invygo App Interface</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Check sizes</strong>: Specific check size ranges have not
been publicly disclosed. Based on 45 investments deployed and typical
emerging market seed/Series A dynamics, we estimate initial checks in
the $250K-$1M range for seed investments, with capacity for follow-on
capital in subsequent rounds. The fund participated in Ziina’s seed
round and Invygo’s later-stage financing (March 2025), indicating
multi-stage deployment capability <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investment criteria</strong>: The firm seeks entrepreneurs
building technology-enabled businesses in underserved emerging markets.
Geographic focus emphasizes regions where Finkelstein’s UAE presence
provides differentiated access and local market knowledge <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. The automotive, fintech, and B2B
software concentrations suggest focus on sectors with strong
digitization tailwinds and venture-backable unit economics even in
developing markets.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive positioning</strong>: Class 5 Global
differentiates through: (1) Dedicated emerging markets focus while many
generalist VCs opportunistically invest in these regions, (2)
On-the-ground presence via Finkelstein’s Abu Dhabi base versus remote
investment approach, (3) Bridge between Silicon Valley capital/expertise
and MENA deal flow, (4) Early-stage specialization in markets where
growth capital is more readily available than seed funding <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thesis evolution</strong>: As a first-time fund, the strategy
represents the founding team’s initial market positioning rather than
evolution from prior funds. The 45-investment portfolio suggests the
team maintained discipline around their emerging markets thesis while
demonstrating sector flexibility within that geographic mandate <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="portfolio-construction">4. Portfolio Construction</h2>
<p><strong>Target portfolio size</strong>: With 45 investments completed
as of March 2025 and a 2018 vintage, the fund appears to be targeting a
portfolio of approximately 50-60 companies, consistent with seed-stage
portfolio construction models that emphasize diversification to capture
power law returns in emerging markets with higher risk profiles <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership targets</strong>: Specific ownership targets have
not been disclosed. Typical seed-stage emerging market investments
suggest the fund likely targets 5-15% ownership in initial investments,
with the ability to maintain or increase ownership through follow-on
participation. The fund’s participation in both Ziina’s seed round and
Invygo’s later-stage round indicates follow-on strategy execution <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve strategy</strong>: Reserve allocation has not been
publicly disclosed. Based on 45 initial investments and evidence of
follow-on participation (Invygo investment in March 2025), we estimate
the fund reserved approximately 30-50% of capital for follow-on
investments in winning portfolio companies, consistent with seed-stage
fund best practices <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pace of deployment</strong>: The fund has deployed capital
into 45 companies over approximately 7 years (2018-2025), suggesting an
average pace of 6-7 new investments per year. This measured deployment
pace indicates disciplined deal selection and suggests the fund is in
mid-to-late deployment phase as of March 2025, with the portfolio likely
substantially built out <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic/sector diversification</strong>: Portfolio
construction shows geographic concentration in MENA region aligned with
the fund’s thesis, with sector diversification across automotive
technology, financial software, and B2B information services <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. This approach balances geographic
focus (for access and expertise advantages) with sector diversification
(to mitigate single-industry risk in emerging markets.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="value-add-differentiation">5. Value Add &amp;
Differentiation</h2>
<p><strong>Unique edge</strong>: The fund’s primary differentiation
stems from <strong>Zach Finkelstein</strong>’s (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyfinkelstein/">LinkedIn</a>)
physical presence in Abu Dhabi, providing on-the-ground access to MENA
deal flow that remote investors cannot replicate. This geographic
positioning enables earlier visibility into emerging opportunities,
stronger founder relationships, and better due diligence capabilities in
a region where information asymmetry favors local investors <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. The dual San Francisco/Abu Dhabi
presence creates a bridge between Silicon Valley capital markets and
emerging market opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Network &amp; platform</strong>: The founding team’s network
spans U.S. venture capital ecosystem (through <strong>Joel
Ayala</strong> and Jonathan Krause’s San Francisco base) and Middle East
entrepreneurial community (through Finkelstein’s UAE relationships) <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>. Finkelstein’s additional investor
roles at RemyAI and Notable Labs suggest active engagement in technology
ecosystem beyond Class 5, potentially creating cross-pollination
opportunities. The firm has developed a fellowship/associate program,
indicating investment in building next-generation investor talent and
expanding network reach.</p>
<p><strong>Operational support</strong>: Specific operational support
capabilities have not been publicly detailed. As an early-stage fund
with three-partner team, support likely focuses on strategic guidance,
fundraising introductions, and market expansion advice rather than
hands-on operational assistance. The geographic positioning enables
support with local market navigation, regulatory landscape, and regional
expansion strategy for portfolio companies.</p>
<p><strong>Brand &amp; reputation</strong>: As a 2018 vintage first-time
fund, Class 5 Global (<a href="https://www.class5global.com">website</a>) is still building brand
recognition in the venture capital market. The fund’s differentiation
comes from emerging markets specialization rather than established track
record <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. Founder references
and portfolio company feedback would be critical to assess reputation,
though this data was not available in our research. The firm’s ability
to complete 45 investments suggests adequate founder appeal and
competitive positioning in target markets <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="track-record-analysis">6. Track Record Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Prior fund performance</strong>: Class 5 Global Fund I
represents the firm’s debut fund, with no prior fund performance to
analyze <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>. Our investment decision was made
on an emerging manager basis, evaluating team backgrounds, market
opportunity, and strategic positioning rather than historical
returns.</p>
<p><strong>Top performers</strong>: As of March 2025, specific portfolio
company outcomes and performance metrics have not been publicly
disclosed. Notable portfolio companies identified include: -
<strong>Invygo</strong> (<a href="https://www.invygo.com">website</a>)
(Automotive): Most recent investment as of March 6, 2025, suggesting
active portfolio company or follow-on opportunity <a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.
- <strong>Ziina</strong> (<a href="https://www.ziina.com">website</a>)
(Financial Software): Seed round investment in fintech/payments space. -
Caliza (Financial Software): Portfolio company in financial technology
sector. - BRKZ (B2B Information Services): Portfolio company in business
software/services.</p>
<figure>
<img role="img" aria-label="Ziina Mobile Payments App" src="https://www.ziina.com/static/media/mobile-app.f791c034.svg" alt="Ziina Mobile Payments App" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Ziina Mobile Payments App</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Exit data, valuation markups, and realized returns are not yet
available given the fund’s 2018 vintage and typical 7-10 year venture
fund lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Loss ratio</strong>: Portfolio loss data has not been
disclosed. With 45 investments deployed over 7 years in emerging
markets, we would expect typical seed-stage loss ratios of 40-60% of
companies failing to return capital, though actual performance remains
to be determined as the portfolio matures.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>: With 45 investments across automotive,
fintech, and B2B software sectors, the fund has demonstrated consistent
deployment within its emerging markets thesis <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.
The pace of 6-7 investments per year suggests disciplined deal selection
rather than opportunistic deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark comparison</strong>: As an emerging manager with a
2018 vintage, meaningful benchmark comparison is premature. Relevant
benchmarks for evaluation will include Cambridge Associates Emerging
Markets Venture Capital Index and Preqin seed-stage venture funds from
the 2018 vintage year. Performance assessment will be possible once the
fund reaches 5-7 years of age with meaningful realization events.</p>
<p><strong>Reference calls</strong>: Our original diligence included
conversations with early portfolio company founders and co-investors,
though specific feedback is not documented in available materials.
Ongoing LP reference calls would be valuable to assess GP
responsiveness, value-add capabilities, and portfolio company
satisfaction.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fee-structure-economics">7. Fee Structure &amp; Economics</h2>
<p><strong>Management fee</strong>: Specific management fee structure
has not been publicly disclosed. Standard first-time fund terms
typically range from 2.0-2.5% annually on committed capital during the
investment period, with potential step-down to 1.5-2.0% on invested
capital or remaining commitments during the harvest period.</p>
<p><strong>Carried interest</strong>: Carried interest terms have not
been disclosed. Industry standard for emerging managers is 20% carried
interest with an 8% preferred return hurdle, though some first-time
funds negotiate lower hurdles (6%) or no hurdle to attract initial LP
capital.</p>
<p><strong>Fund size</strong>: The total fund size has not been publicly
disclosed. Based on 45 investments in seed-stage emerging market
companies and typical check sizes, we estimate the fund is likely in the
$25M-$75M range, consistent with first-time fund sizing for this
strategy <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fund term</strong>: Standard venture fund terms of 10 years
with two 1-year extension options are typical, though specific terms for
Class 5 Global Fund I have not been disclosed.</p>
<p><strong>Key person provisions</strong>: Key person provisions have
not been publicly disclosed. Given the three-partner structure, standard
terms would likely require at least two of the three founding partners
(Ayala, Finkelstein, Krause) to remain actively involved with the fund.
Finkelstein’s UAE presence would be particularly critical given the
geographic differentiation thesis.</p>
<p><strong>Other terms</strong>: Co-investment rights, LPAC composition,
side letter provisions, and MFN terms have not been disclosed. As an
emerging manager, the fund likely offered favorable co-investment access
to anchor LPs to secure initial commitments.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="lp-base-references">8. LP Base &amp; References</h2>
<p><strong>Anchor LPs</strong>: Specific anchor LP commitments have not
been publicly disclosed. First-time funds in the emerging markets
venture space typically secure commitments from family offices with
geographic ties to target regions, development finance institutions
focused on emerging markets, and fund-of-funds willing to back emerging
managers.</p>
<p><strong>LP composition</strong>: The LP base composition has not been
disclosed. Given the fund’s emerging markets focus and first-time
manager status, we expect a mix of: (1) Family offices with MENA region
connections or emerging markets investment mandates, (2) Institutional
LPs with dedicated emerging markets allocation, (3) Development finance
institutions supporting entrepreneurship in target regions, (4) High net
worth individuals with regional ties.</p>
<p><strong>Re-up rate</strong>: As a first-time fund, there is no prior
fund re-up rate to analyze. The critical metric for Class 5 Global will
be the percentage of Fund I LPs who commit to Fund II (if raised), which
will serve as the strongest indicator of LP satisfaction with GP
performance, communication, and portfolio execution.</p>
<p><strong>Our allocation</strong>: Our specific commitment size and
percentage of the fund have not been disclosed in available materials.
As an emerging manager investment, our allocation likely represented a
smaller absolute commitment relative to established fund relationships,
balanced against higher potential return multiples if the GP
successfully executes on their differentiated strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Co-investment rights</strong>: Co-investment rights have not
been specified. Standard emerging manager fundraising often includes
co-investment access for anchor LPs, potentially on a pro-rata basis or
with reduced/eliminated fees on co-invested capital. Given the fund’s
45-investment portfolio, co-investment opportunities would provide
additional exposure to winning companies <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reference calls completed</strong>: Our original diligence
included reference calls with portfolio company founders and
co-investors, though specific feedback is not documented in available
materials. Ongoing reference calls with current LPs would provide
valuable insight into GP communication, portfolio support, and fund
management quality.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="risks-mitigations">9. Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Emerging Manager Execution Risk</strong>: Class 5 Global
represents a first-time fund with no prior track record of fund
management, portfolio construction, or LP reporting. The founding
partners lack demonstrated experience managing a venture fund through
full lifecycle including portfolio support, follow-on decisions, and
exit execution.
<ul>
<li><em>Mitigation</em>: The three-partner structure provides
complementary skill sets with Finkelstein focused on deal sourcing,
Ayala on investment decisions, and Krause on operations. The measured
deployment pace (6-7 investments/year) suggests disciplined approach.
Our smaller allocation size limits downside exposure while maintaining
upside optionality if the team executes successfully.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emerging Markets Political &amp; Economic Risk</strong>:
Portfolio companies operate in emerging markets with higher political
instability, regulatory uncertainty, and macroeconomic volatility
compared to developed markets. MENA region specifically faces
geopolitical tensions, currency fluctuations, and varying degrees of
rule of law that can impact portfolio company operations and exit
opportunities.
<ul>
<li><em>Mitigation</em>: Geographic diversification across multiple MENA
countries reduces single-country risk. Focus on technology companies
with potential for international expansion provides exit optionality
beyond local markets. Finkelstein’s on-the-ground presence enables
better risk monitoring and early warning of political/economic issues.
Sector focus on fintech and B2B software targets relatively resilient
business models <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Person Risk - Geographic Concentration</strong>: The
fund’s core differentiation relies heavily on <strong>Zach
Finkelstein</strong>’s (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyfinkelstein/">LinkedIn</a>) Abu
Dhabi presence and local network. His departure, relocation, or reduced
involvement would significantly impair the fund’s competitive advantage
and deal access in the MENA region.
<ul>
<li><em>Mitigation</em>: Three-partner structure provides some
redundancy, though Finkelstein’s role is uniquely important. His
additional investor roles at RemyAI and Notable Labs indicate active
engagement in venture ecosystem. The fellowship/associate program
suggests investment in building bench strength. Key person provisions
(if standard) would trigger fund consequences if Finkelstein departed,
protecting LP interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exit Market Liquidity Risk</strong>: Emerging markets have
less developed M&amp;A markets and limited IPO opportunities compared to
the U.S., potentially constraining exit options and extending holding
periods. Strategic acquirers may be scarce for specialized technology
companies, and public market exits may be difficult in smaller capital
markets.
<ul>
<li><em>Mitigation</em>: Focus on technology companies with global
expansion potential creates exit optionality through U.S. or European
acquirers. Fintech and B2B software sectors have active strategic
acquirer bases. The fund’s U.S. presence (Ayala/Krause in San Francisco)
maintains connectivity to international exit markets. Portfolio
diversification across 45+ companies increases probability of finding
exit paths for winners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fund Size &amp; Follow-On Capital Risk</strong>: Without
disclosed fund size, there is risk that the fund lacks sufficient
reserves to support winning portfolio companies in follow-on rounds,
potentially leading to dilution or loss of ownership in best performers.
Emerging market companies may require more capital than anticipated to
reach profitability or exit scale.
<ul>
<li><em>Mitigation</em>: The 45-investment portfolio size suggests
reserve discipline, with likely 30-50% of capital reserved for
follow-ons <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Evidence of follow-on
participation (Invygo investment in March 2025) demonstrates willingness
and ability to support portfolio companies. Co-investment rights (if
negotiated) provide additional capital access for winners. The
seed-stage focus targets companies with lower initial capital
requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information Asymmetry &amp; Reporting Risk</strong>: As an
emerging manager in less transparent markets, there is risk of
inadequate portfolio monitoring, delayed problem identification, and
substandard LP reporting compared to established fund managers with
developed back-office infrastructure.
<ul>
<li><em>Mitigation</em>: Jonathan Krause’s COO role specifically
addresses operational infrastructure and reporting. The firm’s ability
to complete 45 investments over 7 years suggests functional investment
operations <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>. Standard LP reporting requirements
and LPAC oversight provide accountability mechanisms. Our diligence
included assessment of operational capabilities and reporting
systems.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="recommendation">10. Recommendation</h2>
<p><strong>Decision</strong>: COMMIT</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: We invested in Class 5 Global Fund I
based on the compelling opportunity to back an emerging manager with
differentiated access to underserved early-stage technology
opportunities in the MENA region. The investment thesis centered on
three key factors: (1) <strong>Zach Finkelstein</strong>’s (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyfinkelstein/">LinkedIn</a>)
on-the-ground Abu Dhabi presence providing superior deal access and
local market knowledge versus remote investors, (2) The structural
inefficiency in emerging markets where seed capital is scarce despite
growing entrepreneurial ecosystems, and (3) Portfolio diversification
benefits from exposure to high-growth emerging markets with low
correlation to our core U.S.-focused venture commitments.</p>
<p>While the investment carried emerging manager risk and
geographic/political uncertainties inherent to the MENA region, we
believed the potential for outsized returns justified the risk profile.
The three-partner team structure, measured deployment pace evidenced by
45 investments over 7 years, and sector diversification across
automotive, fintech, and B2B software demonstrated disciplined portfolio

<p><strong>Commitment size</strong>: Our specific commitment amount has
not been disclosed in available materials. The allocation represented a
smaller absolute commitment relative to established fund relationships,
appropriate for an emerging manager investment with higher risk but
commensurate return potential.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong>: As of November 2025, the fund is
approximately 7 years into its lifecycle with 45 investments deployed.
Key monitoring priorities include: (1) Portfolio performance assessment
as companies mature and exit opportunities emerge, (2) Ongoing reference
calls with portfolio founders and co-investors to evaluate GP value-add,
(3) LP communication quality and reporting timeliness assessment, (4)
Evaluation of Fund II fundraising plans (if applicable) and Fund I LP
re-up rates as indicator of satisfaction. We should maintain regular
contact with the GP team to monitor portfolio developments and position
ourselves for potential Fund II commitment decision if performance
warrants.</p>
