```
[Section Label]
THE PROBLEM

[Headline]
Investment memos shouldn't take 20 hours.

[Body - 2-3 short paragraphs or bullet points]
Every deal requires the same grind:
• Hours digging through pitch decks, extracting key data points
• Endless browser tabs researching market size, competitors, team backgrounds
• Struggling to maintain consistent quality and formatting across memos
• Scrambling to add citations and fact-check claims before partner review

Your time should be spent on judgment calls—not copy-paste research.
```

**Visual Element**:
- Optional: Simple illustration of overwhelmed analyst OR
- Stats callout: "Average time to write one memo: 15-25 hours"

---

### 3.4 Solution Section (How It Works)

**Purpose**: Show the magic. Make the complex feel simple.

**Layout**: 3-step horizontal flow (stacks vertically on mobile)

**Content**:
```
[Section Label]
HOW IT WORKS

[Headline]
Three steps. One exceptional memo.

[Step 1]
📄 Upload Your Deck
Drop in a pitch deck PDF. MemoPop extracts company info,
metrics, team details, and funding terms automatically.

[Step 2]
🔍 AI Agents Research & Write
12 specialized agents work in parallel—researching markets,
validating claims, writing sections, adding citations,
and scoring quality.

[Step 3]
✨ Export & Share
Get a polished, citation-rich memo in your firm's branded
template. Export to HTML, PDF, or Word.
```

**Visual Element**:
- Animated diagram showing the agent pipeline

   it at any time.

Q: Can I customize the memo template?
A: Absolutely. Define your own outline, section structure, guiding
   questions, and firm vocabulary. Upload your brand assets for
   consistent exports.

Q: What's the quality of the research?
A: We use Perplexity and Tavily for real-time web research, with
   automatic citation verification. Every claim links to its source.

Q: Does it work for fund commitments (LP memos)?
A: Yes. MemoPop supports both direct investment memos and fund/LP
   commitment memos with different templates and evaluation criteria.

Q: Can I edit the output?
A: Yes. Export to Markdown, HTML, PDF, or DOCX. Edit in any tool
   you prefer, or use our improvement CLI to refine specific sections.

Q: What if the memo needs corrections?
A: Use our corrections workflow to fix inaccuracies, add missing
   information, or adjust narrative tone—then regenerate cleanly.

- **Tablet**: 2-column grids where appropriate
- **Desktop**: Full layouts as designed

### Performance Requirements
- Lighthouse score: 90+ on all metrics
- No layout shift (CLS < 0.1)
- LCP < 2.5s
- Bundle size < 200KB initial JS

### Accessibility

---

## 5. Assets Needed

- [ ] 2-3 screenshot mockups of memo output
- [ ] Favicon (SVG or ICO)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Agent icons/illustrations
- [ ] Customer logos (or placeholders)
- [ ] Demo video or GIF
- [ ] Open Graph image for social sharing

### Can Generate During Build
- [ ] Placeholder testimonials (mark as examples)
- [ ] Feature icons (use icon library)
- [ ] Background patterns/gradients

---

## 6. What NOT to Do

### Design Anti-Patterns
- ❌ No stock photos of "business people shaking hands"
- ❌ No excessive animations or parallax effects
- ❌ No dark patterns (fake urgency, hidden pricing)
- ❌ No walls of text without visual breaks
- ❌ No carousel sliders for critical content

### Technical Anti-Patterns
- ❌ No client-side rendering for above-fold content
- ❌ No massive hero images (optimize/lazy load)
- ❌ No blocking third-party scripts
- ❌ No custom fonts without font-display: swap

### Content Anti-Patterns
- ❌ No vague buzzwords without specifics ("leverage AI to synergize")
- ❌ No claims without backing ("10x faster" needs context)
- ❌ No hiding the product behind "request demo" walls
- ❌ No placeholder "Lorem ipsum" in production

---

## 7. Implementation Notes for AI Assistants

When implementing this spec:

1. **Start with the layout skeleton** - Get all sections in place with placeholder content before styling

2. **Use semantic HTML** - `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, proper heading hierarchy

3. **Component structure**:
   ```
   /components
     /ui          # Reusable primitives (Button, Card, etc.)
     /sections    # Page sections (Hero, Features, Pricing, etc.)
     /layout      # Header, Footer, Container
   ```

4. **Copy is provided** - Use the exact copy from this spec, don't improvise

5. **Colors are defined** - Use CSS variables or Tailwind config, reference the palette above

6. **Mobile-first** - Build mobile layout first, then enhance for larger screens

7. **Test the CTA flow** - All buttons should have clear destinations (even if placeholder)

---

## 8. Success Criteria

The landing page is complete when:

- [ ] All 12 sections are implemented
- [ ] Responsive at all breakpoints (test 375px, 768px, 1280px, 1440px)
- [ ] All links/buttons are functional (or clearly marked as placeholder)
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score > 90
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Looks professional enough to share with potential customers
- [ ] Copy matches this spec exactly (unless explicitly changed)
