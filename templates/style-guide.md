# Investment Memo Style Guide

## Hypernova Writing Standards

### Core Principles

1. **Analytical, not promotional** - Maintain objective assessment
2. **Specific over vague** - Use exact metrics, dates, and names
3. **Balanced perspective** - Acknowledge risks alongside opportunities
4. **Information density** - Every sentence should add value
5. **Source attribution** - Cite sources for market claims

## Good vs. Bad Examples

### Market Sizing

**❌ BAD**:
> "The market for AI-powered analytics is massive and growing rapidly."

**✅ GOOD**:
> "The enterprise analytics software market was $23B in 2023 (Gartner), growing at 15% CAGR. AI-native solutions represent ~8% of this ($1.8B) but are expanding faster at 35% CAGR as companies shift from legacy BI tools."

**Why**: Specific figures, sources cited, growth rates quantified, context provided.

---

### Traction Metrics

**❌ BAD**:
> "The company has strong early traction with several Fortune 500 customers."

**✅ GOOD**:
> "Current traction includes 12 paying customers ($180K ARR), with 3 design partners (Boeing, Northrop, Lockheed) piloting at no cost. Average contract size is $15K annually for initial deployments."

**Why**: Exact numbers, customer quality specified, revenue broken out from pilots.

---

### Risk Assessment

**❌ BAD**:
> "There is some regulatory risk, but the team is working on compliance."

**✅ GOOD**:
> "**Regulatory Risk**: NRC approval required for commercial deployment (12-18 month process, estimated 60% success rate for new reactor designs). *Mitigation*: Team hired former NRC commissioner Sarah Chen as advisor; pre-application meeting scheduled Q1 2024; backup strategy includes DOD-only deployment which bypasses NRC."

**Why**: Specific agency named, timeline quantified, probability assessed, concrete mitigation steps with named people and dates.

---

### Team Assessment

**❌ BAD**:
> "The founders have impressive backgrounds in the industry."

**✅ GOOD**:
> "**Sarah Johnson** (CEO): 8 years at SpaceX leading Dragon power systems, MIT PhD in nuclear engineering. Previous startup (PowerTech) acquired by GE for $45M. **David Kim** (CTO): Lead architect on NASA's Kilopower reactor, 15+ patents in miniaturized nuclear systems."

**Why**: Specific companies, roles, outcomes, and credentials. Quantified achievements.

---

### Technology Description

**❌ BAD**:
> "The company uses cutting-edge AI and machine learning to revolutionize the industry."

**✅ GOOD**:
> "Core technology: transformer-based protein folding model trained on 500M protein sequences (vs. AlphaFold's 170M). Reduces compute time from 8 hours to 12 minutes for novel protein prediction. Current accuracy: 87% vs. AlphaFold's 90%, but improving 2% monthly."

**Why**: Specific technical approach, comparative benchmarks, quantified performance with honest gap analysis.

## Tone Guidelines

### Words to Avoid (Promotional)
- Revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive
- Massive, huge, enormous (without numbers)
- Best-in-class, world-class, leading
- Poised to, positioned to
- Exponential (unless literally exponential with data)

### Preferred Phrasing (Analytical)
- "Growing at X% CAGR from Y to Z" (instead of "rapidly growing")
- "Competitors include A, B, C" (instead of "crowded market")
- "Risk mitigated by X" (instead of "low risk")
- "Team previously at A, B, C" (instead of "experienced team")
- "Raised $X at $Y valuation" (instead of "well-funded")

---

## Structural Requirements

### Section Length Targets
- **Executive Summary**: 150-250 words
- **Business Overview**: 200-300 words
- **Market Context**: 300-400 words
- **Technology & Product**: 250-350 words
- **Traction**: 200-300 words
- **Team**: 200-250 words
- **Funding & Terms**: 150-200 words
- **Risks**: 300-400 words (4-6 distinct risks)
- **Investment Thesis**: 200-300 words
- **Recommendation**: 100-150 words

### Formatting Standards
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Bold key metrics and names
- Include dates for all milestones
- Spell out acronyms on first use
- Use inline citations (Source: X) for market data
- Separate risks from mitigations clearly

---

## Common Quality Issues

### 1. Vague Market Claims
❌ "The industry is worth billions"
✅ "$12.5B in 2023 (PitchBook), projected $18B by 2027"

### 2. Unsupported Competitive Positioning
❌ "They are the only company doing this"
✅ "Direct competitors: Acme ($50M Series B), BetaCorp (acquired by Google). Differentiation: 3x faster processing, 40% lower cost per transaction"

### 3. Missing Risk Mitigations
❌ List risks without addressing them
✅ Each risk must include specific mitigation strategy

### 4. Promotional Founder Bios
❌ "Visionary leader with passion for innovation"
✅ "Previously VP Engineering at Stripe (2018-2022), scaled team from 12 to 200 engineers"

### 5. Undefined Technical Terms
❌ Use "low-latency edge computing" without explanation
✅ "Edge computing (processing data on local devices vs. cloud) with <50ms latency"
