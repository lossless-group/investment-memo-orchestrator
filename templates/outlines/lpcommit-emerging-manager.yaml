          For first-time fund managers without DPI/TVPI/IRR:
          1. Highlight portfolio storytelling - breakout companies, notable follow-on rounds with announced valuations and or marquee investors
          2. Use angel MOIC if available from personal investing history
          3. Reference prior fund experience at other firms if applicable
          4. Future: incorporate user-provided scorecard frameworks

    preferred:
      - term: "empathy"
        usage: "Insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators"
        definition: |
          The ongoing privilege to invest in competitive early-stage deals rests on deep,
          insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators. Reputational
          feedback loops are tight and have outsized effects.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "How well does the GP understand founder psychology and motivations?"
          - "What evidence exists of deep relationships with portfolio founders?"
          - "Do founders seek this GP's advice beyond investment matters?"
          - "What is the GP's reputation among founders they didn't invest in?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Founder references"
          - "Portfolio company testimonials"
          - "GP's founder-facing content and communications"
          - "Repeat founder relationships"

          - "Transactional relationships with founders"
          - "Limited follow-on from existing portfolio founders"
          - "Negative feedback from founders on deals that didn't close"
        scoring:
          5: "Exceptional founder relationships; founders actively seek GP's involvement; strong reputation even among non-portfolio founders"
          4: "Strong founder empathy; good references; founders recommend GP to others"
          3: "Adequate relationships; standard investor-founder dynamics"
          2: "Surface-level relationships; limited founder advocacy"
          1: "Transactional approach; poor founder feedback"

      - term: "theory of market"
        usage: "Well-sharpened theory on market evolution and company building"
        definition: |
          The ability to anticipate the performance horizon of companies at the earliest
          stages looks like intuition and luck, but it's forged from creating a well-sharpened,
          experience and information rich theory on market evolution and company building.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "Can the GP articulate a clear, differentiated market thesis?"
          - "How has their thesis evolved with market changes?"
          - "What evidence supports their market predictions?"
          - "Do they have unique information advantages in their focus areas?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Written thesis documents"
          - "Public talks and podcasts"
          - "Portfolio company selection patterns"
          - "Timing of investments relative to market trends"
        red_flags:

          - "Thesis that doesn't explain portfolio construction"
          - "No evidence of thesis refinement over time"
        scoring:
          5: "Highly differentiated, proven thesis with clear track record of prescient investments"
          4: "Clear thesis with supporting evidence; some proven predictions"
          3: "Articulate thesis but limited differentiation or track record"
          2: "Generic thesis; hard to distinguish from market consensus"
          1: "No clear thesis; reactive rather than anticipatory investing"

      - term: "ecosystem imprint"
        usage: "Memorable presence among founders, brokers, and syndicate investors"
        definition: |
          The first few investment rounds of any company are put together through deeply
          formed interpersonal relationships and off-the-cuff recommendations. Even good
          investors can be quickly forgotten and be left out. Outstanding investors are
          uniquely memorable to a large group of busy, high-velocity founders, relationship
          brokers, and syndicate investors.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "How well-known is this GP in their target ecosystem?"
          - "Do other investors proactively share deals with this GP?"
          - "Is the GP a 'must-have' on cap tables in their space?"
          - "What is their visibility at key industry events?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Co-investor references"
          - "Deal flow sources and quality"
          - "Social media/content presence"

        red_flags:
          - "Unknown to other investors in their stated focus"
          - "Relies primarily on inbound cold outreach"
          - "No proactive deal sharing from ecosystem"
        scoring:
          5: "Category-defining presence; automatically included in best deals; 'must-have' investor"
          4: "Well-known in ecosystem; regularly receives proactive deal flow"
          3: "Recognized but not top-of-mind; adequate deal access"
          2: "Limited ecosystem presence; struggles for deal access"
          1: "Unknown in target ecosystem; relies on cold outreach"

      - term: "hustle"
        usage: "Super-human level of omnipresence and energy"
        definition: |
          Rising above the world of existing early-stage venture firms requires
          sweat-inducing levels of energy. The methods are myriad, but the result
          is a super-human level of omnipresence. GPs are somehow at the right events,
          have met with the right founders, are in the right deals, all before lesser
          investors even get a strategy together.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "What is the GP's meeting cadence and founder outreach volume?"
          - "How quickly do they respond to opportunities?"
          - "Are they consistently present at key ecosystem events?"
          - "Do they create their own deal flow through proactive outreach?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Meeting and outreach metrics"
          - "Event attendance and hosting"
          - "Response time to opportunities"
          - "Content production and thought leadership"
        red_flags:
          - "Passive investment approach"
          - "Slow response to opportunities"
          - "Limited proactive founder engagement"
        scoring:
          5: "Exceptional energy; omnipresent in ecosystem; creates own luck through relentless activity"
          4: "High energy; proactive approach; consistently present"
          3: "Adequate activity level; standard VC engagement"
          2: "Below average activity; reactive approach"
          1: "Passive; minimal proactive engagement"

    description: "Evaluating how the GP executes on opportunities"
    preferred:
      - term: "pull force"
        usage: "Becoming the 'go-to' investor for their market thesis"
        definition: |
          As a company becomes a clear breakout opportunity, many founders short-cut
          running an investment process with the wider venture market. They figure out
          who the "go-to" investors are, and the rounds are done quickly. Great investors
          become a "go-to" for their market thesis and investment strategy.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "Do founders specifically seek out this GP?"
          - "Is the GP's name synonymous with a particular space?"
          - "How often do they win competitive deals?"
          - "Are they getting allocation in oversubscribed rounds?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Win rate in competitive deals"
          - "Allocation in hot rounds"
          - "Brand recognition in focus area"
          - "Inbound deal flow quality"
        red_flags:
          - "Rarely wins competitive situations"
          - "Not associated with any particular space"
          - "Struggles to get allocation"
        scoring:
          5: "Category leader; founders specifically seek them out; wins most competitive deals"
          4: "Strong pull; recognized expert in space; good win rate"
          3: "Adequate brand; sometimes wins competitive deals"
          2: "Limited brand recognition; rarely wins competitive"
          1: "No pull; unknown or avoided by quality founders"

      - term: "pounce"
        usage: "Move quickly with prepared, built-in due diligence"
        definition: |
          Momentum rounds are circulated and closed in such short-order, the only way
          to participate is to move quickly, seemingly shortcutting professional process.
          The due diligence is there, but it's prepared and built into the DNA of the firm.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "How quickly can the GP make investment decisions?"
          - "Do they have pre-built conviction in their focus areas?"
          - "Is their diligence process efficient without being shallow?"
          - "Have they lost deals due to slow process?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Time from first meeting to term sheet"
          - "Deal velocity metrics"
          - "Pre-existing research in focus areas"
          - "References on decision-making speed"
        red_flags:
          - "Multi-month decision processes"
          - "Lost deals due to slow diligence"
          - "No pre-built conviction or research"
        scoring:
          5: "Lightning fast; pre-built conviction enables rapid decisions; wins on speed"
          4: "Quick mover; efficient diligence; rarely loses to timing"
          3: "Standard pace; sometimes misses time-sensitive deals"
          2: "Slow process; frequently loses to faster investors"
          1: "Glacial; process prevents competitive participation"

      - term: "integrity"
        usage: "Waver-less integrity in difficult moments"
        definition: |
          At least 40% of partner time deals in drama of some kind. And most report
          that eventually 60% of all their investments will underperform. Being a
          shareholder across this recurring drama requires waver-less integrity in
          moments that may otherwise bring out the worst in lesser stakeholders.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "How does the GP behave when companies struggle?"
          - "Do they maintain supportive relationships through difficulties?"
          - "What is their reputation for fair dealing?"
          - "How do they handle conflicts of interest?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Founder references on difficult situations"
          - "Co-investor references"
          - "Handling of failed investments"
          - "Reputation in legal/restructuring situations"
        red_flags:
          - "Adversarial behavior with struggling companies"
          - "Reputation for sharp dealing"
          - "Conflicts of interest concerns"
        scoring:
          5: "Impeccable integrity; founders and co-investors trust completely; gold standard"
          4: "Strong integrity; good reputation; trusted partner"
          3: "Adequate integrity; no major concerns"
          2: "Some concerns; mixed references"
          1: "Poor reputation; integrity issues documented"

      - term: "grip"
        usage: "Deep trust enables continued access in growth rounds"
        definition: |
          After companies achieve breakout momentum, growth investors line up and
          compete to get into tightly controlled rounds. The best early-stage investors
          have deep trust with founders and board directors, so often get continued
          access to invest in the company even when others are locked out.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "What is the GP's follow-on investment rate in winners?"
          - "Do they maintain pro-rata in competitive growth rounds?"
          - "How strong are board relationships?"
          - "Do founders want them to continue investing?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Follow-on investment data"
          - "Pro-rata maintenance in growth rounds"
          - "Board seat retention"
          - "Founder references on continued involvement"
        red_flags:
          - "Low follow-on rate in winners"
          - "Lost board seats"
          - "Squeezed out of growth rounds"
        scoring:
          5: "Exceptional grip; always maintains access; founders insist on continued participation"
          4: "Strong grip; usually maintains pro-rata; trusted board member"
          3: "Adequate grip; sometimes maintains access"
          2: "Weak grip; frequently loses access in growth rounds"
          1: "No grip; systematically squeezed out"

    description: "Evaluating the GP's portfolio construction and management"
    preferred:
      - term: "judgement"
        usage: "Codified systems for repeatable deal selection"
        definition: |
          Firms with reputations will find themselves awash in opportunities. The
          resulting volume is incomprehensible without deliberate systems for repeating
          and scaling a codified sense of judgement — applied across screening, selecting,
          and securing access to those deals that best fit the firm and their strategy.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "Does the GP have a systematic investment process?"
          - "How do they filter high-volume deal flow?"
          - "Is their selection criteria consistently applied?"
          - "Can they articulate why they passed on deals?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Investment process documentation"
          - "Screening criteria and metrics"

          - "Inconsistent selection criteria"
          - "Can't explain passes"
        scoring:
          5: "Highly systematic; repeatable judgement at scale; clear criteria consistently applied"
          4: "Strong process; good filtering; mostly consistent"
          3: "Adequate process; some systematization"
          2: "Inconsistent; ad hoc decisions"
          1: "No system; chaotic decision making"

      - term: "discipline"
        usage: "Purposeful focus despite distractions and peer pressure"
        definition: |
          VC Firms will see a rise of distractions, hyped opportunities, and implicit
          peer-pressure. Inclinations to abandon process, retro-fit strategy to mirror
          haphazard portfolio construction, or neglect the important for the urgent.
          Firms must be purposeful with their limited focus and capital.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "Does the GP stick to their stated strategy?"
          - "How do they handle FOMO on hot deals outside their focus?"
          - "Is portfolio construction consistent with thesis?"
          - "Have they avoided strategy drift?"
        evidence_sources:
          - "Portfolio consistency analysis"
          - "Strategy drift evidence"

        scoring:
          5: "Exceptional discipline; portfolio perfectly matches thesis; resists all distractions"
          4: "Strong discipline; mostly consistent; occasional strategic expansion"
          3: "Adequate discipline; some drift"
          2: "Limited discipline; portfolio inconsistent with thesis"
          1: "No discipline; chases every opportunity"

      - term: "positioning"
        usage: "Differentiated, unique market position"
        definition: |
          Long-term, multi-fund success requires partnerships to align their combined
          theses, strategy, and brand to a differentiated, unique positioning in the
          market. Firm positioning may difficult to distinguish from an industry outsider,
          but those with deep context can recall the positioning of dozens of firms from memory.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "What is the GP's unique positioning?"
          - "How differentiated are they from competitors?"
          - "Can ecosystem participants articulate their positioning?"

          4: "Clear differentiation; well-understood positioning"
          3: "Some differentiation; adequate positioning"
          2: "Limited differentiation; hard to distinguish"
          1: "No clear positioning; generic"

      - term: "prudence"
        usage: "Outstanding prudence with struggling portfolio companies"
        definition: |
          Limited Partner capital is often burned to support portfolio companies that
          do not fail, but continuously struggle to find breakout growth. The pressures
          to continue supporting these companies get the best of investors who can't
          exercise outstanding prudence, often at odds with interest of others around the table.
        evaluation_questions:
          - "How does the GP manage struggling portfolio companies?"
          - "Do they make rational follow-on decisions?"

      Key risks of backing an emerging manager, properly weighted.
      Market timing and thesis validation are highest weight.
      Some "standard" risks matter less than institutional LPs think.

    guiding_questions:
      macro_risks:
        - "Market timing risk: Is this a good vintage year to deploy? What's the macro environment?"
        - "Thesis validation risk: Is the GP's thesis correct? Will the market move their direction?"

      gp_behavior_risks:
        - "Scattered/drift: Does the GP stay focused or chase shiny objects? Do they have discipline?"
        - "Atrophy: Will the GP stay 'in the flow'? Risk of moving to Hawaii and losing edge, network, deal access."
        - "Over-confidence: Does GP make high-conviction bets then throw good money after bad with delusion? Can they kill their darlings?"
        - "Inattention: Does GP pay attention to full pipeline AND full portfolio? Risk of missing winners while nursing losers."

      structural_risks:
        - "Fundraising risk: Will they hit their target?"
        - "Key person risk: What if the GP gets hit by a bus?"

      how_we_think:
        scattered_drift: |
          This is a real risk. Look for evidence of focus and discipline. Do they have a clear thesis
          they stick to, or do they chase every hot sector? References often surface this.
        atrophy: |
          GPs who stay hungry, stay in the ecosystem, keep showing up - they maintain edge.
          Watch for lifestyle creep or signals they're "done" building relationships.
        over_confidence: |
          The best GPs can admit when they're wrong and cut losses. The worst double down on losers
          while ignoring portfolio companies that are actually working. Ask about their mistakes.
        inattention: |
          With small portfolios, every company matters. Missing a winner because you were focused
          on a loser is the cardinal sin. How does GP allocate time across portfolio?
        fundraising_risk: |
          We don't actually care if they don't meet their target. Most emerging managers don't.
          Sometimes missing target makes them more deliberate with bets, more hungry to succeed
          to raise a bigger Fund II.
        key_person_risk: |
          This is a legal/structural risk and there is insurance. But it's inevitable when a
          fund has 1-2 people max. To be honest, no one we know of has actually been hit by
          a bus, so the real-world playbook here is unclear. We accept this as inherent to
          the emerging manager category.
