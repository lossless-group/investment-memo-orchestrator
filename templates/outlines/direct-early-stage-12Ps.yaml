  philosophy: |
    The 12Ps framework organizes investment analysis around the customer journey and
    company capability, not traditional VC memo sections. This creates a more intuitive
    narrative: Why would anyone care? → How big is this? → Who is building it? →
    What exactly is it? → Is it worth it?

    Each section concludes with a scorecard table showing the 3 P-dimensions evaluated,
    providing both narrative depth and structured scoring.
