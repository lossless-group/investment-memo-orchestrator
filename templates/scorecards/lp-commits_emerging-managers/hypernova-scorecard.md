# Hypernova Capital: Emerging Manager Scorecard

**Framework for Evaluating LP Commitments to Emerging VC Managers**

Version 1.0.0 | Last Updated: November 2025

---

## Overview

This 12-dimension framework enables systematic evaluation of emerging venture capital managers (GPs) for LP commitment decisions. Each dimension captures a critical aspect of GP capability that predicts long-term fund performance.

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Label | Percentile |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Exceptional | Top 2-5% |
| 4 | Above Average | Top 10-25% |
| 3 | Average | Top 50% |
| 2 | Below Average | Bottom 50% |
| 1 | Bottom Quartile | Bottom 25% |

### Dimension Groups

The 12 dimensions are organized into three groups, each placed strategically within the investment memo:

1. **Founder & Deal Dynamics** (4 dimensions) — After Executive Summary
2. **Execution & Investment Style** (4 dimensions) — Within Fund Strategy section
3. **Portfolio Management & Discipline** (4 dimensions) — Within Track Record section

---

## Group 1: Founder & Deal Dynamics

*Evaluating the GP's relationship with founders and deal access*

### Empathy

**What it measures**: Insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators

> The ongoing privilege to invest in competitive early-stage deals rests on deep, insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators. Reputational feedback loops are tight and have outsized effects.

**Questions to Answer**:
- How well does the GP understand founder psychology and motivations?
- What evidence exists of deep relationships with portfolio founders?
- Do founders seek this GP's advice beyond investment matters?
- What is the GP's reputation among founders they didn't invest in?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Founder references
- Portfolio company testimonials
- GP's founder-facing content and communications
- Repeat founder relationships

**Red Flags**:
- Transactional relationships with founders
- Limited follow-on from existing portfolio founders
- Negative feedback from founders on deals that didn't close

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Exceptional founder relationships; founders actively seek GP's involvement; strong reputation even among non-portfolio founders |
| 4 | Strong founder empathy; good references; founders recommend GP to others |
| 3 | Adequate relationships; standard investor-founder dynamics |
| 2 | Surface-level relationships; limited founder advocacy |
| 1 | Transactional approach; poor founder feedback |

---

### Theory of Market

**What it measures**: Well-sharpened theory on market evolution and company building

> The ability to anticipate the performance horizon of companies at the earliest stages looks like intuition and luck, but it's forged from creating a well-sharpened, experience and information rich theory on market evolution and company building.

**Questions to Answer**:
- Can the GP articulate a clear, differentiated market thesis?
- How has their thesis evolved with market changes?
- What evidence supports their market predictions?
- Do they have unique information advantages in their focus areas?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Written thesis documents
- Public talks and podcasts
- Portfolio company selection patterns
- Timing of investments relative to market trends

**Red Flags**:
- Vague or generic thesis (e.g., "AI is big")
- Thesis that doesn't explain portfolio construction
- No evidence of thesis refinement over time

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Highly differentiated, proven thesis with clear track record of prescient investments |
| 4 | Clear thesis with supporting evidence; some proven predictions |
| 3 | Articulate thesis but limited differentiation or track record |
| 2 | Generic thesis; hard to distinguish from market consensus |
| 1 | No clear thesis; reactive rather than anticipatory investing |

---

### Ecosystem Imprint

**What it measures**: Memorable presence among founders, brokers, and syndicate investors

> The first few investment rounds of any company are put together through deeply formed interpersonal relationships and off-the-cuff recommendations. Even good investors can be quickly forgotten and be left out. Outstanding investors are uniquely memorable to a large group of busy, high-velocity founders, relationship brokers, and syndicate investors.

**Questions to Answer**:
- How well-known is this GP in their target ecosystem?
- Do other investors proactively share deals with this GP?
- Is the GP a "must-have" on cap tables in their space?
- What is their visibility at key industry events?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Co-investor references
- Deal flow sources and quality
- Social media/content presence
- Speaking engagements and industry recognition

**Red Flags**:
- Unknown to other investors in their stated focus
- Relies primarily on inbound cold outreach
- No proactive deal sharing from ecosystem

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Category-defining presence; automatically included in best deals; "must-have" investor |
| 4 | Well-known in ecosystem; regularly receives proactive deal flow |
| 3 | Recognized but not top-of-mind; adequate deal access |
| 2 | Limited ecosystem presence; struggles for deal access |
| 1 | Unknown in target ecosystem; relies on cold outreach |

---

### Hustle

**What it measures**: Super-human level of omnipresence and energy

> Rising above the world of existing early-stage venture firms requires sweat-inducing levels of energy. The methods are myriad, but the result is a super-human level of omnipresence. GPs are somehow at the right events, have met with the right founders, are in the right deals, all before lesser investors even get a strategy together.

**Questions to Answer**:
- What is the GP's meeting cadence and founder outreach volume?
- How quickly do they respond to opportunities?
- Are they consistently present at key ecosystem events?
- Do they create their own deal flow through proactive outreach?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Meeting and outreach metrics
- Event attendance and hosting
- Response time to opportunities
- Content production and thought leadership

**Red Flags**:
- Passive investment approach
- Slow response to opportunities
- Limited proactive founder engagement

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Exceptional energy; omnipresent in ecosystem; creates own luck through relentless activity |
| 4 | High energy; proactive approach; consistently present |
| 3 | Adequate activity level; standard VC engagement |
| 2 | Below average activity; reactive approach |
| 1 | Passive; minimal proactive engagement |

---

## Group 2: Execution & Investment Style

*Evaluating how the GP executes on opportunities*

### Pull Force

**What it measures**: Becoming the "go-to" investor for their market thesis

> As a company becomes a clear breakout opportunity, many founders short-cut running an investment process with the wider venture market. They figure out who the "go-to" investors are, and the rounds are done quickly. Great investors become a "go-to" for their market thesis and investment strategy.

**Questions to Answer**:
- Do founders specifically seek out this GP?
- Is the GP's name synonymous with a particular space?
- How often do they win competitive deals?
- Are they getting allocation in oversubscribed rounds?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Win rate in competitive deals
- Allocation in hot rounds
- Brand recognition in focus area
- Inbound deal flow quality

**Red Flags**:
- Rarely wins competitive situations
- Not associated with any particular space
- Struggles to get allocation

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Category leader; founders specifically seek them out; wins most competitive deals |
| 4 | Strong pull; recognized expert in space; good win rate |
| 3 | Adequate brand; sometimes wins competitive deals |
| 2 | Limited brand recognition; rarely wins competitive |
| 1 | No pull; unknown or avoided by quality founders |

---

### Pounce

**What it measures**: Moving quickly with prepared, built-in due diligence

> Momentum rounds are circulated and closed in such short-order, the only way to participate is to move quickly, seemingly shortcutting professional process. The due diligence is there, but it's prepared and built into the DNA of the firm.

**Questions to Answer**:
- How quickly can the GP make investment decisions?
- Do they have pre-built conviction in their focus areas?
- Is their diligence process efficient without being shallow?
- Have they lost deals due to slow process?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Time from first meeting to term sheet
- Deal velocity metrics
- Pre-existing research in focus areas
- References on decision-making speed

**Red Flags**:
- Multi-month decision processes
- Lost deals due to slow diligence
- No pre-built conviction or research

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Lightning fast; pre-built conviction enables rapid decisions; wins on speed |
| 4 | Quick mover; efficient diligence; rarely loses to timing |
| 3 | Standard pace; sometimes misses time-sensitive deals |
| 2 | Slow process; frequently loses to faster investors |
| 1 | Glacial; process prevents competitive participation |

---

### Integrity

**What it measures**: Waver-less integrity in difficult moments

> At least 40% of partner time deals in drama of some kind. And most report that eventually 60% of all their investments will underperform. Being a shareholder across this recurring drama requires waver-less integrity in moments that may otherwise bring out the worst in lesser stakeholders.

**Questions to Answer**:
- How does the GP behave when companies struggle?
- Do they maintain supportive relationships through difficulties?
- What is their reputation for fair dealing?
- How do they handle conflicts of interest?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Founder references on difficult situations
- Co-investor references
- Handling of failed investments
- Reputation in legal/restructuring situations

**Red Flags**:
- Adversarial behavior with struggling companies
- Reputation for sharp dealing
- Conflicts of interest concerns

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Impeccable integrity; founders and co-investors trust completely; gold standard |
| 4 | Strong integrity; good reputation; trusted partner |
| 3 | Adequate integrity; no major concerns |
| 2 | Some concerns; mixed references |
| 1 | Poor reputation; integrity issues documented |

---

### Grip

**What it measures**: Deep trust enables continued access in growth rounds

> After companies achieve breakout momentum, growth investors line up and compete to get into tightly controlled rounds. The best early-stage investors have deep trust with founders and board directors, so often get continued access to invest in the company even when others are locked out.

**Questions to Answer**:
- What is the GP's follow-on investment rate in winners?
- Do they maintain pro-rata in competitive growth rounds?
- How strong are board relationships?
- Do founders want them to continue investing?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Follow-on investment data
- Pro-rata maintenance in growth rounds
- Board seat retention
- Founder references on continued involvement

**Red Flags**:
- Low follow-on rate in winners
- Lost board seats
- Squeezed out of growth rounds

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Exceptional grip; always maintains access; founders insist on continued participation |
| 4 | Strong grip; usually maintains pro-rata; trusted board member |
| 3 | Adequate grip; sometimes maintains access |
| 2 | Weak grip; frequently loses access in growth rounds |
| 1 | No grip; systematically squeezed out |

---

## Group 3: Portfolio Management & Discipline

*Evaluating the GP's portfolio construction and management*

### Judgement

**What it measures**: Codified systems for repeatable deal selection

> Firms with reputations will find themselves awash in opportunities. The resulting volume is incomprehensible without deliberate systems for repeating and scaling a codified sense of judgement — applied across screening, selecting, and securing access to those deals that best fit the firm and their strategy.

**Questions to Answer**:
- Does the GP have a systematic investment process?
- How do they filter high-volume deal flow?
- Is their selection criteria consistently applied?
- Can they articulate why they passed on deals?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Investment process documentation
- Screening criteria and metrics
- Pattern analysis of investments
- Pass decisions and rationale

**Red Flags**:
- Ad hoc decision making
- Inconsistent selection criteria
- Can't explain passes

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Highly systematic; repeatable judgement at scale; clear criteria consistently applied |
| 4 | Strong process; good filtering; mostly consistent |
| 3 | Adequate process; some systematization |
| 2 | Inconsistent; ad hoc decisions |
| 1 | No system; chaotic decision making |

---

### Discipline

**What it measures**: Purposeful focus despite distractions and peer pressure

> VC Firms will see a rise of distractions, hyped opportunities, and implicit peer-pressure. Inclinations to abandon process, retro-fit strategy to mirror haphazard portfolio construction, or neglect the important for the urgent. Firms must be purposeful with their limited focus and capital.

**Questions to Answer**:
- Does the GP stick to their stated strategy?
- How do they handle FOMO on hot deals outside their focus?
- Is portfolio construction consistent with thesis?
- Have they avoided strategy drift?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Portfolio consistency analysis
- Strategy drift evidence
- Deals passed due to discipline
- Response to market hype cycles

**Red Flags**:
- Portfolio doesn't match thesis
- Chased hot sectors outside expertise
- Strategy changed without clear rationale

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Exceptional discipline; portfolio perfectly matches thesis; resists all distractions |
| 4 | Strong discipline; mostly consistent; occasional strategic expansion |
| 3 | Adequate discipline; some drift |
| 2 | Limited discipline; portfolio inconsistent with thesis |
| 1 | No discipline; chases every opportunity |

---

### Positioning

**What it measures**: Differentiated, unique market position

> Long-term, multi-fund success requires partnerships to align their combined theses, strategy, and brand to a differentiated, unique positioning in the market. Firm positioning may be difficult to distinguish from an industry outsider, but those with deep context can recall the positioning of dozens of firms from memory.

**Questions to Answer**:
- What is the GP's unique positioning?
- How differentiated are they from competitors?
- Can ecosystem participants articulate their positioning?
- Is their positioning defensible and authentic?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Brand positioning analysis
- Ecosystem perception
- Competitive differentiation
- Positioning consistency over time

**Red Flags**:
- Generic positioning
- Indistinguishable from peers
- Inconsistent positioning

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Unique, defensible position; immediately recognizable; category-defining |
| 4 | Clear differentiation; well-understood positioning |
| 3 | Some differentiation; adequate positioning |
| 2 | Limited differentiation; hard to distinguish |
| 1 | No clear positioning; generic |

---

### Prudence

**What it measures**: Outstanding prudence with struggling portfolio companies

> Limited Partner capital is often burned to support portfolio companies that do not fail, but continuously struggle to find breakout growth. The pressures to continue supporting these companies get the best of investors who can't exercise outstanding prudence, often at odds with interest of others around the table.

**Questions to Answer**:
- How does the GP manage struggling portfolio companies?
- Do they make rational follow-on decisions?
- How do they handle sunk cost bias?
- What is their approach to recycling capital from failures?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Follow-on decision patterns
- Handling of underperformers
- Write-off timing
- Capital recycling practices

**Red Flags**:
- Throwing good money after bad
- Inability to cut losses
- Sunk cost bias in decisions

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Exceptional prudence; rational capital allocation; quick to recognize and act on failures |
| 4 | Strong prudence; mostly rational follow-on decisions |
| 3 | Adequate prudence; some sunk cost bias |
| 2 | Limited prudence; continues supporting losers too long |
| 1 | Poor prudence; systematically overinvests in failures |
