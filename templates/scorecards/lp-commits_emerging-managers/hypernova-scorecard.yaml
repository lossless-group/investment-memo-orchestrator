    name: "Empathy"
    short_description: "Insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators"
    full_description: |
      The ongoing privilege to invest in competitive early-stage deals rests on deep,
      insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators. Reputational
      feedback loops are tight and have outsized effects.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How well does the GP understand founder psychology and motivations?"
        - "What evidence exists of deep relationships with portfolio founders?"
        - "Do founders seek this GP's advice beyond investment matters?"
        - "What is the GP's reputation among founders they didn't invest in?"

      4: "Strong founder empathy; good references; founders recommend GP to others"
      3: "Adequate relationships; standard investor-founder dynamics"
      2: "Surface-level relationships; limited founder advocacy"
      1: "Transactional approach; poor founder feedback"

  theory_of_market:
    name: "Theory of Market"
    short_description: "Well-sharpened theory on market evolution and company building"
    full_description: |
      The ability to anticipate the performance horizon of companies at the earliest
      stages looks like intuition and luck, but it's forged from creating a well-sharpened,
      experience and information rich theory on market evolution and company building.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Can the GP articulate a clear, differentiated market thesis?"
        - "How has their thesis evolved with market changes?"
        - "What evidence supports their market predictions?"
        - "Do they have unique information advantages in their focus areas?"

        - "Thesis that doesn't explain portfolio construction"
        - "No evidence of thesis refinement over time"
    scoring_rubric:
      5: "Highly differentiated, proven thesis with clear track record of prescient investments"
      4: "Clear thesis with supporting evidence; some proven predictions"
      3: "Articulate thesis but limited differentiation or track record"
      2: "Generic thesis; hard to distinguish from market consensus"
      1: "No clear thesis; reactive rather than anticipatory investing"

  ecosystem_imprint:
    name: "Ecosystem Imprint"
    short_description: "Memorable presence among founders, brokers, and syndicate investors"
    full_description: |
      The first few investment rounds of any company are put together through deeply
      formed interpersonal relationships and off-the-cuff recommendations. Even good
      investors can be quickly forgotten and be left out. Outstanding investors are
      uniquely memorable to a large group of busy, high-velocity founders, relationship
      brokers, and syndicate investors.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How well-known is this GP in their target ecosystem?"
        - "Do other investors proactively share deals with this GP?"
        - "Is the GP a 'must-have' on cap tables in their space?"

      4: "Well-known in ecosystem; regularly receives proactive deal flow"
      3: "Recognized but not top-of-mind; adequate deal access"
      2: "Limited ecosystem presence; struggles for deal access"
      1: "Unknown in target ecosystem; relies on cold outreach"

  hustle:
    name: "Hustle"
    short_description: "Super-human level of omnipresence and energy"
    full_description: |
      Rising above the world of existing early-stage venture firms requires
      sweat-inducing levels of energy. The methods are myriad, but the result
      is a super-human level of omnipresence. GPs are somehow at the right events,
      have met with the right founders, are in the right deals, all before lesser
      investors even get a strategy together.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "What is the GP's meeting cadence and founder outreach volume?"
        - "How quickly do they respond to opportunities?"
        - "Are they consistently present at key ecosystem events?"

      4: "High energy; proactive approach; consistently present"
      3: "Adequate activity level; standard VC engagement"
      2: "Below average activity; reactive approach"
      1: "Passive; minimal proactive engagement"

  pull_force:
    name: "Pull Force"
    short_description: "Become the 'go-to' investor for their market thesis"
    full_description: |
      As a company becomes a clear breakout opportunity, many founders short-cut
      running an investment process with the wider venture market. They figure out
      who the "go-to" investors are, and the rounds are done quickly. Great investors
      become a "go-to" for their market thesis and investment strategy.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Do founders specifically seek out this GP?"
        - "Is the GP's name synonymous with a particular space?"
        - "How often do they win competitive deals?"

      3: "Adequate brand; sometimes wins competitive deals"
      2: "Limited brand recognition; rarely wins competitive"
      1: "No pull; unknown or avoided by quality founders"

  pounce:
    name: "Pounce"
    short_description: "Move quickly with prepared, built-in due diligence"
    full_description: |
      Momentum rounds are circulated and closed in such short-order, the only way
      to participate is to move quickly, seemingly shortcutting professional process.
      The due diligence is there, but it's prepared and built into the DNA of the firm.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How quickly can the GP make investment decisions?"
        - "Do they have pre-built conviction in their focus areas?"
        - "Is their diligence process efficient without being shallow?"
        - "Have they lost deals due to slow process?"
      evidence_sources:

      3: "Standard pace; sometimes misses time-sensitive deals"
      2: "Slow process; frequently loses to faster investors"
      1: "Glacial; process prevents competitive participation"

  integrity:
    name: "Integrity"
    short_description: "Waver-less integrity in difficult moments"
    full_description: |
      At least 40% of partner time deals in drama of some kind. And most report
      that eventually 60% of all their investments will underperform. Being a
      shareholder across this recurring drama requires waver-less integrity in
      moments that may otherwise bring out the worst in lesser stakeholders.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How does the GP behave when companies struggle?"
        - "Do they maintain supportive relationships through difficulties?"
        - "What is their reputation for fair dealing?"

      2: "Some concerns; mixed references"
      1: "Poor reputation; integrity issues documented"

  grip:
    name: "Grip"
    short_description: "Deep trust enables continued access in growth rounds"
    full_description: |
      After companies achieve breakout momentum, growth investors line up and
      compete to get into tightly controlled rounds. The best early-stage investors
      have deep trust with founders and board directors, so often get continued
      access to invest in the company even when others are locked out.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "What is the GP's follow-on investment rate in winners?"
        - "Do they maintain pro-rata in competitive growth rounds?"
        - "How strong are board relationships?"
        - "Do founders want them to continue investing?"

      3: "Adequate grip; sometimes maintains access"
      2: "Weak grip; frequently loses access in growth rounds"
      1: "No grip; systematically squeezed out"

  judgement:
    name: "Judgement"
    short_description: "Codified systems for repeatable deal selection"
    full_description: |
      Firms with reputations will find themselves awash in opportunities. The
      resulting volume is incomprehensible without deliberate systems for repeating
      and scaling a codified sense of judgement — applied across screening, selecting,
      and securing access to those deals that best fit the firm and their strategy.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Does the GP have a systematic investment process?"
        - "How do they filter high-volume deal flow?"
        - "Is their selection criteria consistently applied?"
        - "Can they articulate why they passed on deals?"

  discipline:
    name: "Discipline"
    short_description: "Purposeful focus despite distractions and peer pressure"
    full_description: |
      VC Firms will see a rise of distractions, hyped opportunities, and implicit
      peer-pressure. Inclinations to abandon process, retro-fit strategy to mirror
      haphazard portfolio construction, or neglect the important for the urgent.
      Firms must be purposeful with their limited focus and capital.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Does the GP stick to their stated strategy?"
        - "How do they handle FOMO on hot deals outside their focus?"
        - "Is portfolio construction consistent with thesis?"

  positioning:
    name: "Positioning"
    short_description: "Differentiated, unique market position"
    full_description: |
      Long-term, multi-fund success requires partnerships to align their combined
      theses, strategy, and brand to a differentiated, unique positioning in the
      market. Firm positioning may be difficult to distinguish from an industry outsider,
      but those with deep context can recall the positioning of dozens of firms from memory.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "What is the GP's unique positioning?"
        - "How differentiated are they from competitors?"
        - "Can ecosystem participants articulate their positioning?"

  prudence:
    name: "Prudence"
    short_description: "Outstanding prudence with struggling portfolio companies"
    full_description: |
      Limited Partner capital is often burned to support portfolio companies that
      do not fail, but continuously struggle to find breakout growth. The pressures
      to continue supporting these companies get the best of investors who can't
      exercise outstanding prudence, often at odds with interest of others around the table.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How does the GP manage struggling portfolio companies?"
        - "Do they make rational follow-on decisions?"
