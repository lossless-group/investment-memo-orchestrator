# Hypernova Capital: Early-Stage Direct Investment Scorecard

**The 12Ps Framework for Evaluating Early-Stage Startup Investments**

Version 1.0.0 | Last Updated: November 2025

---

## Overview

This 12-dimension framework enables systematic evaluation of early-stage startup investments. The "12Ps" methodology organizes evaluation into five groups that progress from understanding the customer (Origins) through market opportunity (Opening), company capability (Organization), complete offering (Offering), and investment worthiness (Opportunity).

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Label | Percentile |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Exceptional | Top 5% |
| 4 | Above Average | Top 10-25% |
| 3 | Average | Top 50% |
| 2 | Below Average | Bottom 50% |
| 1 | Weak / Missing | Bottom 25% |

### The 12Ps Structure

The 12 dimensions are organized into five groups, each answering a fundamental question:

1. **Origins** (3Ps) — "Why would anyone care about you?"
   - Persona, Pain, Proposition

2. **Opening** (3Ps) — "How big is this problem and how can this company compete?"
   - Problem, Possibility, Positioning

3. **Organization** (3Ps) — "Who is this company and how are they achieving something remarkable?"
   - People, Process, Product

4. **Offering** (Synthesis) — "What are they building and serving to the market?"
   - Synthesizes: Proposition + Positioning + Product

5. **Opportunity** (3Ps) — "Is this worth investing in relative to our opportunity costs?"
   - Potential, Progress, Plan

---

## Group 1: Origins

*"Why would anyone care about you?"*

### 1. Persona

**What it measures**: Who is the target customer and what is their story?

> Who is the target customer? Who are the surrounding stakeholders? What is their story? What is their current condition that can be impacted by your offering?

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is the target customer clearly defined with specific characteristics?
- Are the surrounding stakeholders (users, buyers, influencers) identified?
- What is the day-in-the-life story of this persona?
- What is their current condition and workflow before your solution?
- How well does the company understand this persona's world?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Customer interviews and testimonials
- User research documentation
- Persona definitions and segmentation
- Customer journey maps
- Founder's direct experience with persona

**Red Flags**:
- Vague or overly broad customer definition
- No primary research with actual customers
- Multiple conflicting personas without clear prioritization
- Founders can't articulate the persona's daily reality

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Crystal-clear persona with deep ethnographic understanding; founders have lived in the customer's shoes; specific, named personas with documented stories |
| 4 | Well-defined persona with solid research backing; good understanding of stakeholder ecosystem |
| 3 | Adequate persona definition; some customer research but gaps in depth |
| 2 | Vague persona definition; mostly assumptions rather than research |
| 1 | No clear target customer; "everyone" is the customer |

---

### 2. Pain

**What it measures**: Why are they motivated to care? What is the problem from their perspective?

> Why are they motivated to care? What is the problem that they specifically have, from their point of view, and in their own language? How much of a priority is this for them?

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is the pain articulated in the customer's own language?
- How urgent and important is this pain to the customer?
- Is this a "hair on fire" problem or a "nice to have" improvement?
- What are the consequences of NOT solving this problem?
- How much time/money are they currently wasting on this problem?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Customer quotes and verbatims
- Willingness-to-pay research
- Current spending on alternatives/workarounds
- Frequency and intensity of pain occurrence
- Customer prioritization rankings

**Red Flags**:
- Pain described in founder's language, not customer's
- Solution looking for a problem
- Nice-to-have rather than must-have problem
- Customers not actively seeking solutions
- Low priority problem among many competing priorities

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Hair-on-fire pain that customers desperately want solved; articulated perfectly in customer's language; clear priority #1 problem |
| 4 | Significant pain with strong customer motivation; high priority problem with quantified impact |
| 3 | Real pain but not always top priority; moderate urgency |
| 2 | Nice-to-have problem; customers acknowledge but don't prioritize |
| 1 | Manufactured pain; solution looking for a problem |

---

### 3. Proposition

**What it measures**: What are you promising and how do you frame the solution?

> What are you promising your target customer and your stakeholder? How do you frame a solution or a hope for something better?

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is the value proposition clear and compelling?
- Can you explain it in one sentence?
- Does it directly address the identified pain?
- Is the promise believable and achievable?
- What transformation are you promising?

**Evidence Sources**:
- Positioning statements and messaging
- Customer response to value proposition
- A/B testing of messaging
- Sales conversion rates
- Customer feedback on why they chose the product

**Red Flags**:
- Confusing or jargon-filled proposition
- Promise doesn't connect to pain
- Overclaiming capabilities
- Me-too value proposition without differentiation

**Scoring Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Instantly clear, emotionally resonant value proposition; customers repeat it back perfectly; creates "aha" moment |
| 4 | Clear proposition that directly addresses pain; well-differentiated from alternatives |
| 3 | Understandable proposition but may require explanation; some differentiation |
| 2 | Confused or generic proposition; hard to remember or repeat |
| 1 | No clear proposition; features masquerading as benefits |

## Group 4: Offering

*"What is it they are specifically building, offering, and serving to the market?"*

This group is a **synthesis** of three dimensions from other groups:

| Dimension | From Group | Reference |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Proposition** | Origins | See Section 3 |
| **Positioning** | Opening | See Section 6 |
| **Product** | Organization | See Section 9 |

The "Offering" perspective evaluates how well these three elements work **together** as an integrated whole:

**Synthesis Questions**:
- Does the Proposition (promise) align with the Positioning (differentiation)?
- Does the Product deliver on both the Proposition and Positioning?
- Is there coherence between what's promised, how it's differentiated, and what's delivered?
- Would a customer experience a consistent story from marketing through product use?

When scoring, evaluate the **integration** of these elements, not just their individual scores.
